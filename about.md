Hi, I'm Evan Tulsky. I share an interest in robotics, dynamics and controls, and rehabilitative devices. Having admired my father leading cognitive tests for quality of life metrics, I have seen the importance of rehabilitative devices to address critical problems including physical challenges. Evan is a doctorate student with over three years of research experience in human-robotic systems and controls for motor deficit rehabilitation with Dr. Victor Duenas. Evan graduated Magna cum laude with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Syracuse University with honors distinction in conjunction with the Renee Crown Honors Program in 2024. He has been awarded the Richard A. Bernard Scholar and the Best Thesis in the Natural Sciences and Engineering for my achievements in independent research.

A little bit about myself

I'm a huge adventurer, and I love to travel. I've taken numerous trips to Europe visiting close relatives in the Netherlands. Further, I have been fortunate to have lived briefly in Italy and could visit Spain, France, Switzerland, Denmark, England, Czechia, Belgium, Scotland, and Luxembourg. Experiencing diverse cultures has progressed my beliefs on a global scale. I am fortunate to have traveled to Peru, Costa Rica, Curacao and Aruba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Israel! Finally, I have seen the diversity of the United States through my conquest to visit every baseball stadium with my father. Admittedly to be able to afford these daring adventures I am a proud Spirit Airlines and hostel traveler.

I value the importance of staying active for improved creativity. I am currently training for my second marathon. To fuel this passion I developed a passion for cooking. Now I cook to experience cultures. 

Between these personable activities, I share an interest in scuba diving, museums, and hiking. I strive for activities that bring me out of my comfort zone. I am in the rudimentary stages of learning Spanish to improve some life goals.
