# Evan Tulsky

Hello, I'm Evan Tulsky, and I've always been fascinated by the intersection of robotics, dynamics, and rehabilitative devices. Witnessing my father's work in cognitive tests for quality of life metrics underscored for me the critical importance of rehabilitative devices in addressing physical challenges.

<h4>A little bit about myself</h4>

a passionate adventurer who finds joy in exploring new cultures and challenging myself through travel. My journeys have taken me across Europe, where I've cherished visits to close relatives in the Netherlands, lived briefly in Italy, and ventured through various European countries. These experiences have enriched my perspective on a global scale.

Beyond Europe, I've been fortunate to explore diverse landscapes and cultures in Peru, Costa Rica, Curacao and Aruba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Israel. Each destination has left an indelible mark, fostering my appreciation for cultural diversity and personal growth.

Back in the United States, my father and I share a quest to visit every baseball stadium, which has allowed me to witness the rich diversity of our own country. To support my adventures, I proudly embrace a budget-friendly approach, traveling with Spirit Airlines and staying in hostels. Life is about experiences and not a photo-op!

Staying active fuels my creativity, whether I'm training for marathons or exploring my passion for cooking, which allows me to immerse myself in various cultures through their cuisine. I am proud to have just ran my second marathon this fall in 2024!

I also enjoy scuba diving and various thrilling activities that push me out of my comfort zone and deepen my understanding of the world. Currently, I'm in the early stages of learning Spanish, driven by personal goals that aim to enhance my experiences and connections.
