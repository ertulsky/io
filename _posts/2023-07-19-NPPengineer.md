For the purpose of protected equipment, supplementary images are omitted. As a nuclear power plant engineer intern I have:
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Participated in various cross-departmental activities, training, and exercises. Developed knowledge of nuclear plant operations, nuclear industry standards, and clean energy initiatives.</li>
  <li>Led and prepared two change modifications apart of the operational fleet initiative that will be implemented during the 2024 outage.</li>
  <li>Performed quality control tasks on nearly 200 engineering change requests. </li>
</ul>

One change modification involved a fleet-wide solution to a reoccurring faulty off-gas drip pot. In repeated instances of failure of the drip pot, increased work during planned power outages increases exposure to radiation in protected areas to mechanics, increases the duration of down-power, and is a hindrance to the operations in the control room for the remainder of the cycle. While the drip pot is not expected to force an outage, it is important to utilize its rated life span of around 10-15 years. The drip pot has experienced repeated failure after 1-4 full cycles (2 - 8 years). The solution was presented to the C-Suite executives in a plant health meeting and implemented in planned outage 2024.

The second change modification involved a fleet-wide solution to a by-pass to the de-ionizer system. The de-ionizer is crucial so ionized water can not pass through the generator. To remain precautionary to a failed de-ionizer (which would result in a forced outage - SCRAM or activation of various safety systems), a by-pass allows for maintenance while a a portable de-ionizer can be active. The solution was accepeted across disciplines (chemistry, operations, mechanical maintenance, and mechanical design) and implemented in planned outage 2024.
