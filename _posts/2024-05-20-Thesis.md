I successfully presented my undergraduate thesis titled, “Targeting the Soleus and Quadriceps Muscles Using Powered
Robotic Rehabilitation Devices and Neuromuscular Control.” In it, I introduce control methods integrating the powered machines and neuromuscular control techniques. The control algorithms address inherent nonlinear effects in the hybrid machines, compensate for human input, and mitigate muscle fatigue. To achieve this, the proposed control designs utilize kinematic feedback to control electric motors to pedal a lower-limb cycle and interface an ankle-foot orthosis. Additionally, neuromuscular control tools such as electromyography, functional electrical stimulation, and vibration stimuli are combined with the electric machines. Controllers are developed to safely combine the machines and neuromuscular tools with assistive technologies in clinical and community settings.

None of this would have been possible without the support and guidance of my advisor, Dr. Victor Duenas, my many mentors, my thesis reader, Steven Evangelos, labmates (Nicholas Rubino, Jonathan Casas, Jade Carter, Miguel Manchola, and Cheng-Hao Cheng), colleagues, family, and friends that have shaped my academic trajectory. Thank you all!

Thank you to everyone who has been part of this incredible journey. Your support, encouragement, and belief in my potential have been the driving force behind my success. I am excited to embark on the next chapter in my career!
