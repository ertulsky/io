<h3 id="Paragraph">"Influence of Vibration Stimuli Applied on the Quadriceps Femoris Muscles During Functional Electrical Stimulation Induced Cycling"</h3>
This paper has been accepted to the International Functional Stimulation Society (IFESS) conference. Due to COVID-19, I presented my work, "Influence of Vibration Stimuli Applied on the Quadriceps Femoris Muscles During Functional Electrical Stimulation Induced Cycling" online in September 2021. Further, this paper can be found on the [Artificial Organs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aor.14132) journal March 2022 edition.
